  dialogue:
  - The art is abstract, but this... It's titled as "Queen of Hell".
  - So this is what she looks like? I was expecting horns, or scales...
  - She's got that symbol behind her, too. Is it some kind of crest? Is she the demon
    Whitewood worshipped?
  - Just what are you, Queen? What's your goal and why does it involve me?
