  dialogue:
  - A well-crafted sculpture of the Baron, the demon that's been after me since I
    was banished.
  - I don't know if he knows I'm in his castle, but I know he's more then capable
    of killing me if we find each other.
  - That said, he wants me alive for something. I don't know if that's a good or
    bad thing yet.
