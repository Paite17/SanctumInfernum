  dialogue:
  - Oh sweet, sweet priest. You have fallen far, most certainly!
  - Destined as a scapegoat, you certainly are, but what journey ends without a climax?
  - Well then, Father Truss, I believe it's time for you to leave, with haste no
    doubt!
  - There is only so much I can do for you in here... But outside? I can get you
    far, far away, oh yes!
  - You can repay my debt when we meet once more... Most certainly!
